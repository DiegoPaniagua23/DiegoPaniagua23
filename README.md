# Hi, I'm Diego 🥷🏼

I'm a Physics Engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistical Computing at the Mathematics Research Center (CIMAT). As a passionate Linux user, my main interests lie in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
